Count of all live births in a given population and time period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data Issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Reporting of some items was incomplete or not collected at all in the early 1990s, therefore all data for those items are shown as Unknown in those years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Preliminary data files may be missing records (particularly those for women who deliver out of state) and/or may contain errors within records that have not yet been corrected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally, 2014 and 2015 were transitional years in New Jersey birth data collection as the old Electronic Birth Certificate (EBC) system was retired and the new Vital Information Platform (VIP) was rolled out in hospitals across the state over a one year period from July 2014 through June 2015. Several birth certificate items are collected differently in the VIP than they were in the EBC and are not directly comparable between the old and the new, therefore all data for those items that were collected through the VIP are shown as Unknown in those years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
